# fastapi_aws

**Files**  
- `crud.py`: specifies crud (create, read, update, delete) actions
- `database.py`: sets up connection with PostgreSQL
- `main.py`: brings all routes together
- `models.py`: sqlalchemy models specified
- `schemas.py`: pydantic models specified, which I believe dictates the output format when API is called
- `routers/`: folder containing subsets of routes
